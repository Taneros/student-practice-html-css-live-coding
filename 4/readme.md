### Question 3: CSS Selectors, Layout, and Flexbox

- **CSS Question:** How do different CSS selectors work (e.g., universal, type, class, ID, and descendant selectors)?
- **CSS Question:** What are the flex properties and how do they affect layout?
- **CSS Question:** How do you style nested elements using CSS?

**Details:**
- **Selectors:** Understanding the use of various CSS selectors such as universal (`*`), type (`p`), class (`.class`), ID (`#id`), and descendant selectors (`parent child`).
- **Flexbox:** The flex container's properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` are used to center items horizontally and vertically. Each flex item should grow equally with the `flex` property.
- **Nested Elements:** Style direct children of a parent element using the child combinator (`>`).

**Instructions:**
1. Create a flex container that centers its items both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.
2. Ensure each item in the flex container grows equally to fill the space.
3. Style direct children of an `ul` element without affecting nested `ul` elements.
