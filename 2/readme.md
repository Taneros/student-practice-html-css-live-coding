### Question 4: Pseudo-Elements and Structural Pseudo-Classes
- **CSS Question:** Why are `::before` and `::after` useful? What's the difference between `:nth-child` and `:nth-of-type`?

**Details:**
- **Pseudo-Elements:** `::before` and `::after` allow you to insert content before or after an element's actual content, often used for decorative purposes without adding extra markup.
- **Structural Pseudo-Classes:** `:nth-child` targets a child element based on its position within its parent, while `:nth-of-type` targets an element based on its type and position among its siblings.


**Instructions**:

- Modify the ::before and ::after content to read have block on the left
  - height and width 10px
  - bg color agua / burlywood
  - margin right and left respectively from content 1 rem

- Change the ::after content to read " - End".

- pick only even elements using selector n-th child
- Ensure the third li element has a yellow background using the :nth-child selector.
